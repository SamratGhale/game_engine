Structure Documentations


Code documentation

Everything that happens outside the loop (Initilization phase)
1. Register windows etc (get the window to run)
2. Graphics backbuffer
3. Create, initilize, clear and start playing win32_sound_output
4. Create sound memory, game memory (Primary, Secondary etc. etc.)
5. Init Input Structures game_memory (OldInput, NewInput)
6. Frame rate and time variables init

There is a loop in the game
Everything that happens in the loop (Everything happens in the loop?)

1. The first thing that happens is User input storing (Bit loop)
2. First call to game code -> need to initilize game structs
game_offscreen_buffer and game_sound_output_buffer just to call GameUpdateAndRender()


//Variables to the soundoutput
